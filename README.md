### Core "Curriculum"

[Main](wikinotes/main.md): Scratch notes right now. Once we begin, everything will be collected here in short version, with the Unit
pages having more full notes, and links to code.

[Unit 1 - Arrays/Sequences](wikinotes/unit1_arrays.md) - notes/problems. Probably most currently useful.

Extra crap

[DSA textbook](dsa_textbook_notes/README.md) - working through this on the side at random.
