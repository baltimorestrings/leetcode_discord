# leetcode thing

This is just scratch notes, though I plan on fleshing them out into simple Anki cards.

This is mostly to jog my own memory, so if some are light, please do feel free to add/edit. The goal isn't
to fully write out every alg (except in the alg sections), but more memory joggers of approach and O(N) drilling.
