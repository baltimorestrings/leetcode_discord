# Linked Lists

Traversal is an easier way to build to binary tree/graph traversals and can be handled
the same two ways - recursion or stack. LL's can also be traversed by simply following
the path of next/prev's, but if you're doing stuff like reversing it, both the visited/not visited
and the recursive model's are useful.

### O(N)

Linked Lists are spacially O(N). Time complexity: Access is O(N), random access is O(N), etc etc.

### Recursive traversal

Not as fast and takes more space, but good practice for recursion. Will flesh these out when I hit the chap, but examples
at [linkedlists.py](../../src/dsa/structures/linked_lists.py) under "recurse_..." and "stack_..."

### Stack traversal
